# Backabo backend

This is an express server that receives requests from the frontend and executes commands towards the Pulumi Automation API.

For more dynamic functionality, the plan is to call resource provider apis directly. There is a placeholder handler for a start/stop function.



## Reference, Acknowledgement

The backend is based on code from the Pulumi Over HTTP repo
